# About
This project will be able to parse `.ibt` files, read live data from races and
broadcast messages to the service. Its still not very mature at all, but after
this commit I will turn it into a package instead and give it a stable API.
Will also put some examples then.


## The SDK
I used various sources to develop and understand how `iRacing` works, and learn
a lot with it. Once I have matured this project a bit I will document its
inner workings too.


## SharedMem
I vendored in the code from [hidez8891/shm](https://github.com/hidez8891/shm) 
since the repo has been archived. I took the opportunity to update some of its
code.
